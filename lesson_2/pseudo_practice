# Casual and formal pseudocode practice

# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers


-- Casual --
Given two integers:
- save sum of two integers into sum variable
- return sum variable


-- Formal --
START

# Given two integers "num1" and "num2"

SET sum = num1 + num2

PRINT sum

END


# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together


-- Casual --
Given an array of strings:

Initiate result variable with empty string.

Iterate through the array one by one.
- concatenate return variable with current string

After iterating, return the result variable.


-- Formal --
START

# Given an array of strings called  "strings"

SET result = ""
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of strings
  SET result = result + current string value at position "iterator" of "strings"
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT result

END


# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element


-- Casual --
Given an array of integers:

Initiate result variable as empty array.

Iterate through array:
- based on 0-based indexing, if current index is odd
  - append result variable with value at current index
- otherwise, if current index is even
  - skip to next iteration

After iterating through array, return the result array

-- Formal --
START

# Given an array of integers called "numbers"

SET result = []
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of numbers
  IF iterator % 2 == 1
    append value to result
  ELSE
    jump to next iteration

PRINT result 


END
